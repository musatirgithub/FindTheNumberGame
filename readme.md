<h3>In this project, my purpose was to create a number guessing game by using DOM. For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I've created a random number between 1-100 by using Math random method,</li>
  <li>Added Event listeners to both click  and keydown events,</li>
  <li>Checked whether the number is empty and if empty returned an alert,</li>
  <li>Limited number interval both at the beginning and at each attempt,</li>
  <li>Returned an alert in case user enters a number out of the interval,</li>
  <li>Turned "CHECK" button into "Restart" button at the end of the game,</li>
  <li>Turned "Restart" button into "CHECK" button if user clicks "Restart",</li>
  <li>Navigated through DOM elements by using commands like getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, parentElement etc.,</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. Hope you like my project! </li>
</ul>
